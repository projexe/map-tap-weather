map-tap-weather
Demo app written by SRH and adapted for release. Takes weather data from Open Weather API and displays in RecyclerView. Latest weather 
persisted in SQLLite using ROOM. API access using Retrofit.

Please ensure that the PROD variant and not the MOCK variant is built. MOCK variant stubs out the database and API for testing.
