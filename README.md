# map-tap-weather

Demo app written for Yell.com. Takes weather data from Open Weather API and displays in RecyclerView. Latest weather persisted in SQLLite using ROOM. API access using Retrofit.

Please ensure that the PROD variant and not the MOCK variant is built. MOCK variant stubs out the database and API for testing.
